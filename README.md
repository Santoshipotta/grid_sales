 Grid Sales Profitability & Pricing Strategy Analysis
 
  Management Request

We have observed a significant decrease in our profit margin across the portfolio, which we attribute primarily to rising cost of goods sold, tariffs, and other factors. Please review our portfolio across the 2023 to 2025 order data to make recommendations in our pricing strategy. Task: Identify all products with a gross margin percentage below 30% in Q3 2025. Create a dashboard showing year-over-year GMP, revenue by category, product, and region. Provide clear data-backed recommendations on which items require a price increase or discontinuation. Please start on this as soon as possible."

 Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project built with SQL and Power BI to analyze sales performance and profitability trends from 2023 to 2025. The goal is to identify products with low gross margin percentages and provide actionable recommendations for pricing strategy improvements.

Tools Used
- SQL (for data processing & analysis)
- Microsoft Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
- Excel (Dataset files)

 Data Source
The project uses raw order data for 2023, 2024, and 2025, along with Customers and Products datasets, stored in the data folder.

 SQL Analysis

The SQL analysis includes:
- Combining order data from 2023, 2024, and 2025 using `UNION ALL`.
- Joining orders with customer and product information to create a consolidated `main_dataset`.

 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard visualizes:

- Year‑over‑Year gross margin percentage trends.
- Revenue breakdown by category, product, and region.
- Low‑margin products.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for revenue and gross margin.

 Key Findings

- Gross margin percentages declined over 2023–2025.
- Several products fell below the 30% gross margin threshold in Q3 2025.
- Revenue distribution revealed weak profitability in specific product lines.

Pricing Recommendations:

Based on the gross margin percentages from the images. Here are the actionable recommendations.
Discontinue or price hike: immediately review and either discontinuing or significantly raise the price by 25% or more for the following products. 
Price after increase of 25%:
Chemex filters (100 pack)- 30.12,
 Logo hoodie(black)- 19.04, 
Minimalist keychain- 34.21. 
Require price adjustment: Increase the price of Goose neck electric kettle to restore its gross margin percentages above 30% threshold.

These actions are necessary because the rising cost of goods sold has made this product unprofitable or structurally weak, contributors to overall profit.
